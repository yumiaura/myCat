## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code style
- Use type hints where possible (already implemented in most places)
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and not too long

## Testing

Currently there are no automated tests, but contributions in this area are very welcome!

Consider adding tests for:
- Sprite loading and parsing
- Configuration save/load
- Window behavior (position, transparency)
- Command-line argument parsing

## Documentation

When adding new features:
- Update the README.md with usage examples
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update type hints if adding new parameters

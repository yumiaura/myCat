### Oct 25, 2025

As a beginner developer, motivation and feedback mean a lot to me while exploring new areas of learning.
That’s why I’d like to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who starred this project.
It may seem like a small thing, but those gestures truly inspire me to keep improving and building.

Not everything goes as smoothly as I’d like — working with graphics is still quite new to me.
However, as promised, I’m releasing the version featuring the anime girl.
Please forgive the rough edges and awkward visuals — I’ll do my best to refine and improve them soon.

Thank you all for your support!
